	abstract = {We study the negative consequences of selfish behavior in a congested network and economic means of influencing such behavior. We consider a model of selfish routing in which the latency experienced by network traffic on an edge of the network is a function of the edge congestion, and network users are assumed to selfishly route traffic on minimum-latency paths. The quality of a routing of traffic is measured by the sum of travel times (the total latency).It is well known that the outcome of selfish routing (a Nash equilibrium) does not minimize the total latency. An ancient strategy for improving the selfish solution is the principle of marginal cost pricing, which asserts that on each edge of the network, each network user on the edge should pay a tax offsetting the congestion effects caused by its presence. By pricing network edges according to this principle, the inefficiency of selfish routing can always be eradicated.This result, while fundamental, assumes a very strong homogeneity property: all network users are assumed to trade off time and money in an identical way. The guarantee also ignores both the algorithmic aspects of edge pricing and the unfortunate possibility that an efficient routing of traffic might only be achieved with exorbitant taxes. Motivated by these shortcomings, we extend this classical work on edge pricing in several different directions and prove the following results.We prove that the edges of a single-commodity network can always be priced so that an optimal routing of traffic arises as a Nash equilibrium, even for very general heterogeneous populations of network users.When there are only finitely many different types of network users and all edge latency functions are convex, we show how to compute such edge prices efficiently.We prove that an easy-to-check mathematical condition on the population of heterogeneous network users is both necessary and sufficient for the existence of edge prices that induce an optimal routing while requiring only moderate taxes.},

	abstract = { A crowding game is a noncooperative game in which the payoff of each player depends only on the player's action and the size of the set of players choosing that particular action: The larger the set, the smaller the payoff. Finite, n-player crowding games often have multiple equilibria. However, a large crowding game generically has just one equilibrium, and the equilibrium payoffs in such a game are always unique. Moreover, the sets of equilibria of the m-replicas of a finite crowding game generically converge to a singleton as m tends to infinity. This singleton consists of the unique equilibrium of the “limit” large crowding game. This equilibrium generically has the following graph-theoretic property: The bipartite graph, in which each player in the original, finite crowding game is joined with all best-response actions for (copies of ) that player, does not contain cycles. }

Deriving upper and lower bounds for this ratio in a model where several agents share a very simple network leads to some interesting mathematics, results, and open problems.22The conference version of this work [Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou (1999) [17]] appeared a decade ago and it has been followed by a large amount of work on the concept of the price of anarchy (as witnessed by the extensive coverage in Nisan et al. (2007) [9]). In this journal version we tried to keep as much as possible the text of the original paper. There are, though, important changes because results that were substantially improved in the meantime are omitted. The other notable change is that here we use the term “price of anarchy” instead of the original term “coordination ratio”. The use of the latter term faded away in the literature, being replaced by the term “price of anarchy” which was first introduced in Papadimitriou (2001) [18].}

	abstract = {We study the efficiency implications of competition among profit-maximizing service providers in communication networks. Service providers set prices for transmission of flows through their (sub)network. The central question is whether the presence of prices will help or hinder network performance. We investigate this question by considering the difference between users' willingness to pay and delay costs as the efficiency metric. Previous work has demonstrated that in networks consisting of parallel links, efficiency losses from competition are bounded. Nevertheless, parallel-link networks are special, and in most networks, traffic has to simultaneously traverse links (or subnetworks) operated by independent service providers. The simplest network topology allowing this feature is the parallel-serial structure, which we study in this paper. In contrast to existing results, we show that in the presence of serial links, the efficiency loss relative to the social optimum can be arbitrarily large. The reason for this degradation of performance is the double marginalization problem, whereby each serial provider charges high prices not taking into account the effect of this strategy on the profits of other providers along the same path. Nevertheless, when there are no delay costs without transmission (i.e., latencies at zero are equal to zero), irrespective of the number of serial and parallel providers, the efficiency of strong oligopoly equilibria can be bounded by 1/2, where strong oligopoly equilibria are equilibria in which each provider plays a strict best response and all of the traffic is transmitted. However, even with strong oligopoly equilibria, inefficiency can be arbitrarily large when the assumption of no delay costs without transmission is relaxed.},

We discuss two toll policies: (a) Tolls are collected on a link basis, (b) Tolls are collected on a path basis. The study shows that there is a degree of freedom in the path-toll collection policy. Alternative criteria are proposed for the exploitation of the degree of freedom such as: (i) that the tolls collected be nonnegative; (ii) that the personal cost of travelers, before and after the imposition of tolls, remains the same; (iii) that certain classes are treated discriminately in order to attain some social good.}

The problem of characterizing the toll set $\tau$, which is the set of all valid toll vectors, is studied. Descriptions and characterizations of $\tau$ are given for the cases when either the cost map is strictly monotonic or is affine monotonic. In the latter case, the cost map is of the form Q$\upsilon$ + c, where Q is a not necessarily symmetric matrix and Q + QTis positive semidefinite. The results are illustrated with several examples.",

The system problem maximizes net benefit to the network users (Gartner, 1980; Yang and Huang, 1998) and the user problem is the usual one of finding equilibrium with elastic demand. We define and characterize T, the set of all tolls for the user problem that achieve the system optimal solution. When solutions to the two problems are unique, T is a polyhedron defined by the optimal solution of the system problem, similar to the case in (Bergendorff, Hearn and Ramana, 1997; Hearn and Ramana, 1998). The Toll Pricing Framework in (Hearn and Ramana, 1998) is also extended to allow optimization of secondary criteria over T.
